          My Web development journey started in college, where I was introduced
          to programming in general. After college I continued to learn Python,
          but didn't fall in love with data science behind it. Since I'm more of
          a "visual" person, front-end web development is where I decided to
          invest my time and effort. After facing many challenges and constantly
          learning something new, I realised that this is what I want to master.
